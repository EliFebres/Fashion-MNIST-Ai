# Fashion-MNIST-Ai

Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize and classify images of clothing using the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Here's an example of how the data looks:

## Model

I copied the TinyVGG, used in the [CNN explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/), to help construct the model. The provided link goes in depth into CNNs and the TinyVGG model, so there is no need to explain it here.

Model Stats:
Train loss: 0.22176 | Train accuracy: 91.83% | Test loss: 0.27062 | Test accuracy: 90.36%

## Model Evaluation
I believe the model's performance is more accurate than its raw accuracy percentage suggests. The low quality 28x28 images can sometimes lead to misclassifications, even by a human observer. If we were to exclude the images that humans would struggle to distinguish, it should improve the model's accuracy and better represent its true capabilities.

For instance, in the 3x3 grid of incorrect predictions, we see some challenges. On the last row, the second and third image could easily be misclassified by humans, let alone a simple TinyVGG model.

**Despite these data challenges, I consider the model successful as it correctly and consistently classifies images that one would expect a model of this nature to get correct.**
